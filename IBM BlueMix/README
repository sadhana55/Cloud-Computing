A number of services provide free (limited) storage, and several provide an
easy to use, comfortable interface, such as a folder (subdirectory) on your desktop
where you may drop file to be automatically backed up (to the cloud service and
retrieved – or even shared between users), or web-based interface.
Several of these services: Dropbox, Sugarsync, Skydrive, Googledrive, and iCloud
offer free storage and most importantly – an API where you may program utilities
to use these storage services.

Here, we create a utility to provide “Storage as a Service” which will:
Securely store and retrieve files to a cloud service provider.
We provide following services to a user:
Store a copy of a local file, encrypted, on your (Cloud) service.
Retrieve (and decrypt) a remote file
List all files on your service
Delete a remote file
Limit the maximum sizes of remote files to 1 MB, or less, each
and no more than 10 MB, in total.
